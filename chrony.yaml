    package:
      name: chrony # required. Package name, or package specifier with version. Syntax varies with package manager. For example C(name-1.0) or C(name=1.0). Package names also vary with package manager; this module will not "translate" them per distro. For example C(libyaml-dev), C(libyaml-devel).
      state: present # required. Whether to install (C(present)), or remove (C(absent)) a package. You can use other states like C(latest) ONLY if they are supported by the underlying package module(s) executed.
      use: auto # not required. The required package manager module to use (yum, apt, etc). The default 'auto' will use existing facts or try to autodetect it. You should only use this field if the automatic selection is not working for some reason.
